# ed25519-gpu-vanity

A CUDA-based miner for finding ED25519 vanity public keys (encoded as Solana Base58 addresses) ending with a specific suffix (default: "pump").

**Warning:** Keys generated by this tool are **NOT SECURE** and should not be used for any sensitive applications. Use at your own risk.
**Note:** Base58 encoding on the GPU is less efficient than hex encoding. Expect lower keys/second compared to typical hex vanity address generators.

## Building

Ensure CUDA binaries are in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH # Adjust path if necessary
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Running

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./src/release ./src/release/cuda_ed25519_vanity
```

## Configuration

You can adjust the search parameters by editing the `src/config.h` file and recompiling the project using `make`.

Key configuration options include:

*   `suffix`: Change the target suffix string (default: `"pump"`). Remember to keep it reasonably short for faster searching.
*   `STOP_AFTER_KEYS_FOUND`: Set how many matching keys should be found before the program stops (default: `100`).
*   `MAX_ITERATIONS`: Limits the total number of iterations the program runs (default: `100000`). This acts as a failsafe or time limit.

After modifying `src/config.h`, rebuild the project:

```bash
make clean && make -j$(nproc)
```

## Output

Found keys are collected from the GPU(s) and printed by the host process.
Host-side Base58 encoding is used to display the final keys.

When a matching key is found, the output will look like this:

```
--- MATCH FOUND (GPU <gpu_id>) ---
Public (Base58): [<Base58_public_key_ending_in_suffix>]
Secret (Base58): [<Base58_encoded_64_byte_private_key>]
--------------------------
```

*   The **Public (Base58)** key (e.g., `...pump`) is the Solana vanity address.
*   The **Secret (Base58)** key is the 64-byte expanded private key compatible with Solana wallets (e.g., Phantom allows importing via this format).

**Note:** The Base58 encoding of the public key (which determines the suffix match) is performed on the GPU during the search. The host then re-encodes the raw keys found using Base58 for display.
