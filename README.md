# ed25519-gpu-vanity

A CUDA-based miner for finding ED25519 vanity public keys ending with a specific suffix (default: "pump").

**Warning:** Keys generated by this tool are **NOT SECURE** and should not be used for any sensitive applications. Use at your own risk.

## Building

Ensure CUDA binaries are in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH # Adjust path if necessary
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Running

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./src/release ./src/release/cuda_ed25519_vanity
```

## Configuration

You can adjust the search parameters by editing the `src/config.h` file and recompiling the project using `make`.

Key configuration options include:

*   `suffix`: Change the target suffix string (default: `"pump"`). Remember to keep it reasonably short for faster searching.
*   `STOP_AFTER_KEYS_FOUND`: Set how many matching keys should be found before the program stops (default: `100`).
*   `MAX_ITERATIONS`: Limits the total number of iterations the program runs (default: `100000`). This acts as a failsafe or time limit.

After modifying `src/config.h`, rebuild the project:

```bash
make clean && make -j$(nproc)
```

## Output

When a matching key is found, the output will look like this:

```
MATCH SUFFIX
[<hex_public_key_ending_in_suffix>]
Secret (seed): <seed_in_hex>
```

The HEX public key (e.g., `d9eb...70pump`) is the vanity address.
