# ed25519-gpu-vanity

A CUDA-based miner for finding ED25519 vanity public keys (encoded as Solana Base58 addresses) ending with a specific suffix (default: "pump").

**Warning:** Keys generated by this tool are **NOT SECURE** and should not be used for any sensitive applications. Use at your own risk.
**Note:** Base58 encoding on the GPU is less efficient than hex encoding. Expect lower keys/second compared to typical hex vanity address generators.

## Building

Ensure CUDA binaries are in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH # Adjust path if necessary
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Running

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./src/release ./src/release/cuda_ed25519_vanity
```

## Configuration

You can adjust the search parameters by editing the `src/config.h` file and recompiling the project using `make`.

Key configuration options include:

*   `suffix`: Change the target suffix string (default: `"pump"`). Remember to keep it reasonably short for faster searching.
*   `STOP_AFTER_KEYS_FOUND`: Set how many matching keys should be found before the program stops (default: `100`).
*   `MAX_ITERATIONS`: Limits the total number of iterations the program runs (default: `100000`). This acts as a failsafe or time limit.

After modifying `src/config.h`, rebuild the project:

```bash
make clean && make -j$(nproc)
```

## Output

Found keys are now collected from the GPU(s) and printed by the host process.
Due to performance optimizations (removing `printf` from GPU kernels), the output format has changed.

When a matching key is found, the output will look like this:

```
--- MATCH FOUND (GPU <gpu_id>) ---
Public Key (Hex): <32_byte_public_key_in_hex>
Private Key (Hex, 64 bytes): <64_byte_expanded_private_key_in_hex>
--------------------------
```

*   The **Public Key (Hex)** is the raw 32-byte public key.
*   The **Private Key (Hex, 64 bytes)** is the 64-byte expanded secret key. You would typically need the first 32 bytes of this (the actual secret scalar) to import into wallets, often requiring further conversion (e.g., to Base58).

**Note:** The Base58 encoding of the public key (which determines the suffix match) is still performed on the GPU for the search, but the final output keys are presented in Hex format by the host.
